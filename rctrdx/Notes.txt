# Store have:
dispatch method, getState method, subscribe method

1.what is react-Redux
An official Redux binding only for react

2. Redux-react core parts:
a. Provider : 
React Redux includes a <Provider /> component, which makes the Redux store available to the rest of your app

b. useSelector : useSelector reads a value from the store state and subscribes to updates,

c. useDispatch : useDispatch returns the store's dispatch method to let you dispatch actions.



(a) Provider : 
A provider is a component that makes the redux store available to any nested
Components

eg:

<Provider store={store}>
    <App/>
</Provider>

- We can use the provider anywhere

(b) useSelector :
A hook that allows us to access the data from the ReduxStore.

eg:

store.getState()
//{todos: [...],counter:7}

const todos=useSelector((store)=>store.todos)


(c) useDispatch : 
It's a hook that returns the reference to the dispatch function from the Redux store

eg:

const dispatch=useDispatch();
dispatch(actionObject)
