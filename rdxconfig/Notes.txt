# learning scalling of application with proper structure


1. default state param to initialState

Default param

state=initialState

it will not break teh app if something happen to state
here initialState is contain all the state of other compnent
as well if something breaks in the single Components it
will break the whole application
So, the hack is to come out from this is to
state=initialState.

2. Combine reducer

import of reducer from different folder example below:

```
import {reducer as counterReducer} from "./counter/reducer"
import {reducer as todoReducer} from "./Todo/reducer"

```
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counterReducer,
  todoReducer,
});

3. How to access the state from combineReducers:

```
 const count = useSelector((state) => {
    console.log(state);
    return state.counterReducer.counter;
  });
```

4. Making Authentication and Private Route
-auth with redux (reqres api)
-private route with redux (making store use authreducer use along with Navigate)
